    p1: "I am someone who is passionate about life and everything that challenges me to go beyond. First of all, nice to meet you — I’m Laísa. I enjoy practicing sports, living adventures, listening to music, and watching suspense and action series. I believe life makes more sense when it is shared with the people we love. I seek to inspire those around me to pursue their goals and dreams — and I do so in the way I truly believe in: by chasing my own and, perhaps, becoming an example along the way.",
    p2: "It was with this mindset that I found in technology a path where I could unite passion, continuous learning, and constant growth. Today, I feel fulfilled walking this journey, seeking knowledge every day and challenging myself to grow both professionally and personally. I believe in the transformative power of technology, and I know the future is promising — and I’m excited for everything that lies ahead.",
